# Misha
- The reincarnation of morsh with Mia's own personal lang!
# Indexing and size
- Misha should have an estimated index size of 88 (as in 88 different matches)
- This is "slightly overkill", but works as follows;
 -- The english alphabet has 26 letters
 --- Instead of matching each letter to a single pattern
 ---- Misha matches each 2 letter pair to a pattern (52)
 -- Misha will also feature a single letter fallback index (78)
 --- Plus the numbs 1 - 9 (87) along with a speical pattern for spaces (88)
---
# Obviously with 88 possible patterns Misha isn't meant to be memorized :p
